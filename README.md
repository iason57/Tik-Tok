## Next steps :
1. Search in publisher, exactly like consumer
2. Publisher search, dont show him videos that he published
3. AppNode main that runs publisher and consumer --READY
4. Other computer doesnt receive file, but they are saved here in the project directory
5. make interfaces with function definitions

1. Stop threads ? Consumer continues to run and doesn't stop
2. save every file in txt (100.000 chunks) and then open read and connect them so 
we can send files through the home network and not only the same computer
