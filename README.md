## Next steps :
1. save every file in txt (100.000 chunks) and then open read and connect them so 
we can send files through the home network and not only the same computer
2. Stop threads ? Consumer continues to run and doesn't stop
3. make interfaces with function definitions
4. Search in publisher, exactly like consumer
5. AppNode main that runs publisher and consumer
6. Publisher search, dont show him videos that he published
7. Other computer doesnt receive file, but they are saved here in the project directory
